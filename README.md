## Welcome!

My name is Jan Stefa≈Ñski. Welcome to my github profile.

You're welcome to look around and make use of all of my public repositories with free licences.

While a significant portion of my craft is bound by NDAs, leaving only a glimpse of my work on display here, my passion for open-source makes me wanna contribute whenever the opportunity arises.

Interested in collaborating or just want to say hello? Reach me at [contact@janstefanski.com](mailto:contact@janstefanski.com "Mail me")

Cheers!
