## Welcome!

My name is Jan Stefański ([ˈjan stɛˈfaj᷉ski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Polish)).

I am a junior developer passionate about developing web apps and video games. I always learn new things about programming, development and IT in general.

Currently, I'm especially focused on my studies, so I have less time for my personal code.

This page is my GitHub profile. You're welcome to look around and make use of all of my public repositories.

Most of my works are either unfinished or private due to their nature. Once I feel confident in the code I wrote for them, I'll make it public.

If you are interested in getting in touch with me, you can reach me at [contact@janstefanski.com](mailto:contact@janstefanski.com "Mail me")
